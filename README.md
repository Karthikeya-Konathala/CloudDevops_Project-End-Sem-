## Steps included to perform the project
<b>Create an AWS EC2 instance :</b> Create an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. This will be the server where you will run Jenkins, Ansible, and deploy your application.

<b>Install and configure Docker on the EC2 instance :</b> Install Docker on the EC2 instance and configure it to start automatically at boot time.

<b>Create an IAM role and policy :</b> Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and policy that grants Jenkins permission to access the necessary AWS services, such as EC2, S3, and CloudFormation.

<b>Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance :</b> Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance and configure it to start automatically at boot time.

<b>Set up a Jenkins project :</b> Set up a new Jenkins project and configure it to pull the code from the GitHub repository.

<b>Create a Docker image :</b> Create a Dockerfile that defines the dependencies and environment for your application. Use Docker to build the image and test it locally.

<b>Push the Docker image to Dockerhub :</b> Once you have tested the image locally, push it to Dockerhub. This will make it accessible to other team members or to servers that need to run the application.

<b>Create an AWS CloudFormation template :</b> Create an AWS CloudFormation template that defines the infrastructure required to run the application, such as EC2 instances, security groups, and load balancers.

<b>Set up Ansible on the EC2 instance :</b> Install Ansible on the EC2 instance and configure it to run locally.

<b>Create an Ansible playbook :</b> Create an Ansible playbook that defines the tasks required to deploy the application to the EC2 instances created by CloudFormation.

<b>Configure the Jenkins project :</b> Configure the Jenkins project to use the Ansible playbook to deploy the application to the EC2 instances created by CloudFormation.

<b>Test the deployment :</b> Test the deployment process by triggering a build in Jenkins. The build should pull the code from GitHub, build the Docker image, push it to Dockerhub, create the infrastructure required to run the application using CloudFormation, and deploy the application to the EC2 instances using Ansible.

<b>Monitor the application :</b> Use monitoring tools such as Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the application and ensure that it is running correctly.

<b>Maintain and update the project :</b> As the project evolves, continue to maintain and update the code and deployment process. Use version control to track changes and collaborate with other team members.

###### By following these steps, you can create an end-to-end DevOps project that leverages GitHub, Docker, Dockerhub, Git, Jenkins, Ansible, and AWS EC2 instances to automate the build and deployment process for your application.
